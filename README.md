# Bitcoin-Value-Predict-LSTMs

This report talks about developing a solution to the problem of predicting the value of Bitcoin based on its records from December 2014 to May 2018, using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. The dataset consists of 1273 Bitcoin price records, and in each of these entries, we will have 8 attributes that specify them.

For training and modeling our Neural Network, we use the set of Tensorflow and Keras libraries.
Numpy to represent data and functions.
SkLearn for the data scaling process (preprocessing)
Pandas for Dataframe Representation and Manipulation
MatPlot for graphical visualization of data.
Os for system file manipulation
